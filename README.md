# TL;DR

_What problem does it solve?_

Sqript is a CLI application that runs scripts built with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Its goal is to make development workflows descriptive, composable, and easy to maintain.

# Motivation

_Why it was built?_

NPM [scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts) feature is fine, but I always found it difficult to keep my head around them as development workflows grow. Like in the following personal example.

I've also tried [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) and [ZX](https://github.com/google/zx). They are all great pieces of software (and probably a better alternative to you) but, somehow, I never felt at home with the API.

I think the point was to have something that offers the power and ergonomics of a modern language without losing the simplicity expected from tools peripheral to the programming challenge itself.

The project has very limited ambitions. Although some bugs will undoubtedly come, there are not many more features that I expect to add. If you want to talk just contact me via [Social Media](https://joao.melo.plus).
